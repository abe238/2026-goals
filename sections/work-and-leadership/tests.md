# Test Instructions

See the corresponding milestone instruction file in `product-plan/instructions/incremental/` for detailed user flows and test scenarios.

## General Testing Approach

1. Write tests for each user flow (success and failure paths)
2. Test empty states when no data exists
3. Test component callbacks are fired correctly
4. Test responsive behavior on mobile
5. Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

## Sample Test Data

See `sample-data.json` for example data to use in tests.
